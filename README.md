Bots
====

Bots I made while learning a bit of Python. I love watching NBA, so why not create bots about it.
  
-firstHalfBot.py

    Bot that post on the game thread of r/NBA the first half highlights of the game.
  
-bestNBAPlays.py

    Twitter bot that tweets tbe daily and weekly TOP videos of the NBA youtube channel.
